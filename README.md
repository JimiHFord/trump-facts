# Trump Facts

I truly believe this election is terrifyingly close because the massive amount of scandals and terrifying facts about Donald Trump are too numerous to digest and retain.

Maybe this is compounding it? But hopefully this can be used in project to make a compelling case.

See an example at: [Donald Trump is... ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸš€](http://donaldjtrumpis.com/)

There are four different arrays of facts

* fascist 
* crazy
* liar
* sexist

Inside each of those are an array of objects with the following data

# title

this is an order dependent title, the grammer of which expects the previous fact to have been used

# full_title

a complete sentence for displaying by itself

# urls

an array of urls sourcing the claim

# debunk

an optional object containing a `title` and `urls` array, in case the fact needs debunking.
